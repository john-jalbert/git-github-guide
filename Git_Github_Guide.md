Git & GitHub Collaboration Guide for Beginners

Introduction

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide to Git and GitHub! This guide is designed for two-person collaboration‚Äîperfect for learning Git while working together on coding projects. We'll use Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as our project example throughout this guide.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Git: The Basics

Git is a tool that helps you save, track, and manage changes in your code. Think of it as a time machine for your project! üöÄ

Key Git Concepts:

Repository (Repo): A folder that Git tracks.

Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific point.

Branch: A separate line of development.

Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another.

Push & Pull: Sending and receiving updates from GitHub.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Git & GitHub

Install Git (If You Haven‚Äôt Already)

Windows: Download and install from git-scm.com

Mac: Install using Homebrew: brew install git

Linux: Use your package manager: sudo apt install git

Configure Git (Do this only once per computer)

# Set your name (will be attached to commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email (use the one linked to GitHub)
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Create a New GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a free account.

Click New Repository ‚Üí Name it snow-white-project ‚Üí Click Create Repository.

Copy the provided repository URL.

Clone the Repository (Download It to Your Computer)

git clone https://github.com/your-username/snow-white-project.git
cd snow-white-project  # Move into the project folder

3Ô∏è‚É£ Your First Git Workflow

This is the simple cycle you'll follow while coding together on the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs project.

Step 1: Create a New File & Track It

touch story.txt  # Create a new file to write the story
git add story.txt  # Track the new file

Step 2: Save Your Work (Commit)

git commit -m "Added initial Snow White story draft"

Step 3: Send Your Work to GitHub (Push)

git push origin main

Step 4: Get Updates from GitHub (Pull)

If your partner adds something new, you need to pull it before making your own changes.

git pull origin main

4Ô∏è‚É£ Working in Branches (Avoiding Conflicts!)

A branch is a safe space to experiment with changes without affecting the main project.

Creating a Branch

Let's say one of you wants to work on the dwarfs' names while the other works on Snow White's backstory.

git checkout -b add-dwarfs  # Creates and switches to a new branch

Switching Between Branches

git checkout main  # Switch back to the main branch

Merging Your Changes

Once you're happy with your changes, you can merge them into main.

git checkout main  # Switch to main branch
git merge add-dwarfs  # Merge your changes
git push origin main  # Push merged changes to GitHub

5Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Merge Conflicts (Real-World Example)

A merge conflict happens when two people change the same part of a file. Here‚Äôs how to fix it.

Example Conflict Scenario:

Person A changes the story's introduction and commits it.

Person B also changes the introduction and commits it.

When Person B tries to push, Git says: ‚ÄúMerge conflict!‚Äù

Fixing the Merge Conflict:

Git marks the conflict inside story.txt:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Once upon a time, there was a princess named Snow White.  # Person A's version
=======
Snow White was the fairest of them all, living in a grand castle.  # Person B's version
>>>>>>> add-intro

Edit the file manually, keeping the correct version.

Stage & commit the fixed file:

git add story.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in story introduction"
git push origin main

6Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices for Git Collaboration

‚úÖ Always pull before pushing (git pull origin main). ‚úÖ Use meaningful commit messages (git commit -m "Added Snow White's backstory"). ‚úÖ Keep branches small (One feature per branch). ‚úÖ Resolve merge conflicts together if you're unsure.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced: Introduction to Automated Testing

Why Testing? Before merging code, we want to make sure nothing is broken!

Example: A Simple Python Test with Pytest

Let's say we have a script that counts the dwarfs.

# dwarfs.py
def count_dwarfs():
    return 7

def test_count_dwarfs():
    assert count_dwarfs() == 7

Running the Test

pytest dwarfs.py  # Run the test

Automating Tests with GitHub Actions (Optional)

GitHub can run tests automatically whenever you push changes.

Create a .github/workflows/test.yml file.

Add this code:

name: Run Tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest

Now, GitHub will automatically test your code when you push changes!

Final Thoughts üéâ

Git is a powerful tool for coding together! Start small, practice often, and soon you'll be collaborating like a pro. üöÄ

üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª Next Steps:

Create your snow-white-project repository and start pushing changes.

Try using branches and pull requests.

Experiment with fixing a merge conflict!

üîπ Happy coding! üòä
